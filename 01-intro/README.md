# 🚀 MLOps Journey

This repository documents my **step-by-step learning journey in MLOps**.  
I’m logging everything I explore — from foundational concepts to hands-on experiments — to build a strong understanding of how machine learning models are **developed, deployed, monitored, and scaled in production environments**.

## 📌 1.1 What is MLOps?

**MLOps** (*Machine Learning Operations*) refers to the practices, methodologies, and tools that streamline the **end-to-end lifecycle of ML models**.  

It bridges the gap between:  
👨‍🔬 **Data Scientists** → who build and experiment with models  
⚙️ **Production Systems** → where models are deployed, monitored, and maintained  

Traditionally, ML development and deployment were siloed, causing challenges when transitioning from research to production. MLOps solves this by introducing **best practices for workflow automation, reproducibility, and collaboration**.

### 🔑 Key Concepts in MLOps

- 📂 **Version Control** – Track code, models, and datasets using Git (ensures reproducibility).  
- 🤖 **Automation & Orchestration** – Automate repetitive tasks (data preprocessing, training, deployment) with tools like **Airflow** or **Kubeflow**.  
- 🔄 **CI/CD for ML** – Apply DevOps principles to ML: frequent updates, automated testing, and smooth deployments.  
- 🐳 **Infrastructure & Environments** – Use **Docker/Kubernetes** for portability, scalability, and consistent environments.  
- 📊 **Model Monitoring** – Continuously track performance, detect drift, and trigger retraining pipelines when needed.  
- 👥 **Collaboration & Reproducibility** – Standardize workflows so teams can easily share experiments and reproduce results.  
- ⚖️ **Governance & Compliance** – Ensure fairness, mitigate bias, respect privacy, and follow regulations.  

✅ **Why MLOps?**  
- Increases **efficiency** and **scalability** of ML workflows  
- Ensures **reliability** of deployed models  
- Bridges the gap between **experimentation and production**  
- Enables **faster time-to-market** for ML-driven solutions

## 📌 1.2 MLOps Maturity Model

The table below illustrates the **progressive stages of MLOps adoption**, from no automation to full-scale automation.

| Level | Description | Overview | When to Use? |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **0️⃣ No Automation 😢** | All code in Jupyter notebooks | - No pipelines<br>- No experiment tracking<br>- No metadata management | 🎓 Academic projects<br>🧪 Proof of Concepts (PoC), not production-ready |
| **1️⃣ DevOps but No MLOps 😀** | Best software engineering practices, but ML-awareness missing | - Automated releases<br>- Unit & integration tests<br>- CI/CD pipelines<br>- ❌ No experiment tracking | ✅ When moving from PoC → Production<br>⚙️ Good for engineering automation, but not ML pipelines |
| **2️⃣ Automated Training 🛠** | Data science + engineering collaboration | - Training pipelines<br>- Experiment tracking<br>- Model registry<br>- Easier deployments | 🔥 When ML use cases are growing (3+ use cases)<br>🚀 Great for scaling training workloads |
| **3️⃣ Automated Deployment 💬** | Streamlined deployment & monitoring | - Full pipeline: Data → Train → Deploy<br>- A/B testing<br>- Model versioning (v1, v2)<br>- Performance monitoring | 📊 When multiple business-critical use cases exist<br>⚡ Needed for real-time production systems |
| **4️⃣ Full MLOps Automation ⚙** | Complete end-to-end automation | - Automated training<br>- Automated retraining<br>- Automated deployment<br>- Continuous monitoring | 🏢 Enterprise-grade ML at scale<br>🤖 Use only if levels 2–3 are insufficient<br>⚠️ Pragmatic decision: Do you really need L4? |
