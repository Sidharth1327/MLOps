# MLOps

### [1: Introduction](https://github.com/Sidharth1327/MLOps/tree/main/01-intro)

- 🔎 Overview of **MLOps** and why it matters  
- 📊 Explanation of the **MLOps Maturity Model** 
- 🚖 Introduction to the **NYC Taxi dataset** (our running example)  
- ⏱️ Hands-on notebook: calculating **trip durations** and exploring dataset basics  

### [2: Experiment Tracking](https://github.com/Sidharth1327/MLOps/tree/main/02-experiment-tracking)

Implemented ML experiment tracking workflows with **MLflow**.  
- Set up runs to capture parameters, metrics, artifacts, and source metadata.  
- Logged models both as artifacts and with framework-specific loggers.  
- Compared manual tracking (spreadsheets) vs. automated pipelines.  
- Positioned experiment tracking within the broader ML lifecycle (data → training → versioning → deployment).  
- Built a foundation for reproducibility, collaboration, and scaling experiments.
